        Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that
        automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
        applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now
        maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes
        provides a flexible and robust framework for managing containers and
        their associated resources.

        Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package applications
        and their dependencies. Kubernetes enables developers to build and
        deploy applications in a highly scalable and resilient manner by
        leveraging containerization and automating many of the manual management
        tasks.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #333">Key Features of Kubernetes</h2>

      <ul style="font-size: 18px; color: #333; padding-left: 30px">
        <li>
          <strong>Container orchestration:</strong> Kubernetes automates the
          deployment, scaling, and management of containers across clusters of
          hosts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service discovery and load balancing:</strong> Kubernetes
          provides DNS-based service discovery and load balancing for
          containerized applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic scaling:</strong> Kubernetes can automatically scale
          applications based on resource usage or predefined metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-healing:</strong> Kubernetes can detect and replace
          failed containers or nodes to ensure high availability of
          applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rolling updates and rollbacks:</strong> Kubernetes supports
          rolling updates with zero downtime and provides the ability to
          rollback changes if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secrets and configuration management:</strong> Kubernetes
          allows you to securely manage secrets and configuration data for your
          applications.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Getting Started with Kubernetes
      </h2>

        To get started with Kubernetes, you need to set up a cluster of nodes,
        where each node represents a machine that runs containers. There are
        various ways to create a Kubernetes cluster, such as using managed
        solutions like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
        Service (EKS), or deploying Kubernetes on your own infrastructure using
        tools like kops or kubespray.
      </p>

          text-align: justify;
        "
      >
        Once you have a cluster set up, you can deploy and manage your
        applications using Kubernetes manifests, which define the desired state
        of your applications and their associated resources. These manifests
        specify things like the container images to use, resource requirements,
        networking configurations, and more.
      </p>

        Kubernetes provides a rich set of command-line tools, such as kubectl,
        for interacting with the cluster and managing your applications. You can
        use these tools to monitor the cluster, scale applications, deploy
        updates, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
