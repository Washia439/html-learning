      <h2>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is
        trained on unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no
        predefined labels for the input data. Instead, the algorithm tries to
        find patterns, relationships, or structure within the data on its own.

      <h2>Clustering in Unsupervised Learning</h2>
      <p>
        One of the common tasks in unsupervised learning is clustering.
        Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on
        certain features or characteristics. K-means clustering and hierarchical
        clustering are popular techniques in this context.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Dimensionality Reduction</h2>
      <p>
        Another important aspect of unsupervised learning is dimensionality
        reduction. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used
        to reduce the number of features in the data while preserving its
        essential information.

      <h2>Challenges and Future Trends</h2>
      <p>
        While unsupervised learning is a powerful tool, it comes with its own
        set of challenges, such as selecting the right algorithms and dealing
        with noisy data. Future trends in unsupervised learning include the
        exploration of deep learning approaches and advancements in
        reinforcement learning.
