      <h2>What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?</h2>
      <p>
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence
        (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human
        language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate
        human language in a valuable way.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Examples of NLP Applications</h2>
      <p>NLP has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chatbots and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa</li>
        <li>Text analysis and sentiment analysis</li>
        <li>Machine translation, such as Google Translate</li>
        <li>Speech recognition software</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Importance of NLP</h2>
      <p>
        NLP is crucial for bridging the gap between human communication and
        computer understanding. It allows machines to process vast amounts of
        textual data, automate tasks, and provide human-like interactions in
        various applications.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>How NLP Works</h2>
      <p>
        NLP involves a combination of linguistics, computer science, and machine
        learning. It uses algorithms and models to analyze and extract
        information from text and speech data.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Example: Sentiment Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task that determines the sentiment or
        emotion expressed in a piece of text. Here's an example of sentiment
        analysis:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Text:</strong> "I love this product! It's amazing."</p>
        <p><strong>Sentiment:</strong> Positive</p>
      </div>
