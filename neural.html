        A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize
        underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics
        the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing
        input: so the network generates the best possible result without needing
        to redesign the output criteria.

        The concept of neural networks dates back to the 1940s, but significant
        advancements have been made in recent years, thanks to the increase in
        computational power and the availability of large datasets. This has led
        to breakthroughs in various applications, including computer vision,
        natural language processing, and pattern recognition.

        Neural network theory revolves around the idea that certain key
        properties of biological neurons can be abstracted and used in an
        artificial context, which gives rise to the various types of artificial
        neural networks in use today.
