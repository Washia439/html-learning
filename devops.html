      <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
      <p>
        DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that aim to
        automate and integrate the processes of software development (Dev) and
        IT operations (Ops). It encourages collaboration and communication
        between development and IT teams to deliver high-quality software
        efficiently and quickly.
