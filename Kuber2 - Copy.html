      <h2>Introduction to Kubernetes</h2>
      <p>
        Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that
        automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
        applications. To understand Kubernetes fully, it's crucial to grasp the
        concepts of nodes and services.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Kubernetes Nodes</h2>
      <p>
        Nodes are the worker machines in a Kubernetes cluster. They are
        responsible for running containers and managing the runtime environment.
        Each node typically consists of the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kubelet: Ensures containers are running in a Pod.</li>
        <li>Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes.</li>
        <li>
          Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers (e.g.,
          Docker).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Kubernetes Services</h2>
      <p>
        Services in Kubernetes provide network connectivity to a set of Pods.
        They enable dynamic load balancing and service discovery within the
        cluster. There are different types of services, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ClusterIP: Exposes a service on an internal IP within the cluster.
        </li>
        <li>
          NodePort: Exposes a service on a specific port on each node's IP.
        </li>
        <li>LoadBalancer: Provides a dedicated load balancer for a service.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Kubernetes Pods</h2>
      <p>
        Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain
        one or more containers that share the same network and storage
        namespace. Pods are often used to group containers that need to work
        together closely.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Kubernetes Ingress</h2>
      <p>
        Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object used to manage external access to
        services within the cluster. It enables the configuration of rules for
        routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different services based on hostnames
        and paths.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Kubernetes StatefulSets</h2>
      <p>
        StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications in Kubernetes.
        Unlike regular Pods, StatefulSets provide stable network identities and
        stable storage. They are commonly used for databases and other stateful
        workloads.
