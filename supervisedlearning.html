      <h2>Introduction to Supervised Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm
        learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions
        without human intervention. It is a crucial concept in the field of
        artificial intelligence and data science.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Supervised Learning Works</h2>
      <p>
        In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with a dataset
        containing input-output pairs. The algorithm's goal is to learn a
        mapping function that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen
        inputs. This is achieved through the process of training, where the
        algorithm adjusts its internal parameters based on the training data.

      <h2>Types of Supervised Learning</h2>
      <p>Supervised learning can be categorized into two main types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Classification:</strong> In classification tasks, the
          algorithm predicts a discrete label or category. For example,
          classifying emails as spam or not spam.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regression:</strong> In regression tasks, the algorithm
          predicts a continuous numeric value. For example, predicting the price
          of a house based on its features.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Algorithms Used in Supervised Learning</h2>
      <p>
        There are various algorithms used in supervised learning, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Decision Trees</li>
        <li>Random Forest</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
        <li>Neural Networks</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        While supervised learning is powerful, it has its challenges, such as
        overfitting, data quality, and the need for labeled data. Researchers
        and practitioners continually work on improving algorithms and
        addressing these challenges.
